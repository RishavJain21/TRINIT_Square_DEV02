Employee Hierarchy 

Task Assignment by higher level employee to lower-level Employee  

List of Bugs solved and raised by you and many more 

How To Use: To use our bug tracker SQUARE, you need to sign up to the web application. Once you sign up as a user you will get diverse options which includes all the previous bugs you have reported and their status if they have been resolved or not. As a user you can add new bug you found. You can also chat with the person involved in resolving your bug and see a report at resolved bugs page.   The admin can add employees in his projects where employees will see the task assigned to them and their fellow team mates who are on the same hierarchical level or below them. An employee can only assign tasks to employee who is at a lower employee level which is determined by numbers ranging from 1 to 5.
